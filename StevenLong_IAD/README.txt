CS:GO Shopping List

This app allows players of the game Counter Strike: Global Offensive to calculate the cost of the equipment they would like to purchase in game.
Players can view all in game items, and their respective cost, organized by type.
Items the player desires can be selected by touching the screen. Doing so will increase the total cost, number of items bought, and will add the items name
to the list of purchased items. Players can review their purchases and see the total cost of all items.

IMPORTANT!

As I mentioned in my emails to you, I had no way to test this app whatsoever. This was due to lacking access to a Hyper-V enabled computer or a windows phone device.
I have done my best to ensure it will work, but without being able to run it, the application may not behave how I intended.
