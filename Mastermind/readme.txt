In this version of mastermind players make guesses by typing the first letter of their chosen colour('_' for blanks).
If, at any point, the player mis-types something or enters invalid data the program will account for this
and allow them to try again. Instructions are available in game. The game saves the high score to an external file,
along with the difficulty played and the number of turns taken to win. The current high score is available in game.
Beating the game with a high score will overwrite the previous high score.
The score is based on difficulty, number of turns taken and turns left.
If the player fails to guess the code they will be informed of it when their turns run out.
